# Jump

Jump will be a simple jump and run game.
The game is written in Java(TM).
For the development process I use Netbeans 8.2 with the Oracle JDK 1.8u121.

The game should have...
 - [] multiple levels
 - [] a level design tool
 - [] nice pixelarts
 - [] a network multiplayer mode
 - [] a score system
 - [] an easy to use and modern looking interface
