# Jump

Jump will be a simple jump and run game.
The game is written in Java(TM) .
To develop I use Netbeans 8.2 with the Oracle JDK 1.8u121.

The game should have...
 - multiple levels
 - a level design tool
 - nice pixelarts
 - a network multiplayer mode
 - a point system
 - a easy to use interface
